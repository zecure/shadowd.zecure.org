## Foundations

This project tries to achieve:

 * Protection of web applications by analyzing and filtering user input
 * Coverage of all common web languages with a single solution
 * Simple, secure and auditable modules
 * Deterministic and reproducible behaviour
 * Quality over quantity

## Pending

### Partly done

 * Localization

### Nice to have

 * Graphical representation of attacks
 * Iterative learning in shadowd, i.e. do not store all requests in learning mode
 * Support of HTTP security headers for additional security
 * Decoding filters for user input, e.g., base64, xml, json and yml
